# Netflix data analysis exercise:
## data loading, storage and file format

## data cleaning and preparation

## data wragling/ munging
Analyze the data by year division to compared overall trend and the trend over last 5 years
Besides, there are also some data wrangling for countries and top 10 countries data. 


## Plotting and visualization
This cover basic visualization of histogram, line, bar and stack bar

# what I learned from this project:
I learned a bunch of new techniques to slice the data, to pivot, to merge,... which allows me to dive into the dataset better 
The matplotlib is actually very tough library, even though I am quite proficient with chart using MS office, matplotlib take it to another level. But it is also very useful to actually going under the hood of a chart and plot everything from the scratch.
I do feel Python together with these libraries give user much more flexibitlity to have more granular look at the data and illustrate it.

# what can be improved:
This is my first project using Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis, there are plenty of new things that I have learned through the project
The code is not really efficiently written and there are a lot of unnecessart repeated code which can be implement through def functions
The illustration is very basic which can be improved by adding more brand color, using more complicated chart (heat map, scatter,... ) or use seaborn for better visualization
